# Pico W Web Server - (a fun weekend project)

I've been wanting to learn more about working with the Raspberry Pi Pico, and came across some great projects on the [DIY Projects Lab website](https://diyprojectslab.com/). One of the projects that I found interesting was the "[Raspberry Pi Pico W Web Server](https://diyprojectslab.com/raspberry-pi-pico-w-web-server/)." I purchased a couple of Raspberry Pi Picos a year ago with the idea of potentially using them to connect into the web and use them for an automated cat feeder project. This web server project helped me to learn more about working with the Pico, and I feel like it's one step closer to helping me learn how to use the devices in other applications. 

Below, I will provide my tweaks to the project (adapted from the DIY Projects Lab website). 

## What You Need

*   Raspberry Pi Pico W
*   MicroPython
*   Thonny IDE
*   Basic Micropython/HTML knowledge

## Web Server Setup

1.  Install MicroPython: Download the UF2 file from the [MicroPython website](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/). Hold the BOOTSEL button on your Pico W and connect it to your computer. Copy the UF2 file to the Pico W.
2.  Install Thonny IDE: Download and install Thonny from [thonny.org](https://thonny.org/).
3.  Connect to Pico W: In Thonny, go to "Tools" -> "Options" -> "Interpreter" and select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)".
4.  Create `wifi_secrets.py`: Create a file named `wifi_secrets.py` with your Wi-Fi credentials.
5.  Create `index.html`: Create a file named `index.html`.
6.  Create `style.css`: Create a file named `style.css`.
7.  Create `main.py`: Create a file named `main.py`.
8.  Upload Files: Upload all files (`wifi_secrets.py`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.py`) to your Pico W.

The Pico W acts as a web server. Access its IP in your browser to control the LED!

## My Changes

*   Refactored HTML
*   CSS: Moved styles to `style.css`.
*   Docs Link: Updated to: [Raspberry Pi Pico W Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html#picow-technical-specification).

You can find the code for this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/yourgithubusername/pico-w-web-server).

Thanks to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for their documentation.

## Conclusion

This is a great intro to web servers and Micropython on the Pico W. Adapt existing projects to learn and create!

# Pico W Web Server - (a fun weekend project)

I've been wanting to learn more about working with the Raspberry Pi Pico, and came across some great projects on the [DIY Projects Lab website](https://diyprojectslab.com/). One of the projects that I found interesting was the "[Raspberry Pi Pico W Web Server](https://diyprojectslab.com/raspberry-pi-pico-w-web-server/)." I purchased a couple of Raspberry Pi Picos a year ago with the idea of potentially using them to connect into the web and use them for an automated cat feeder project. This web server project helped me to learn more about working with the Pico, and I feel like it's one step closer to helping me learn how to use the devices in other applications.

Below, I will provide my tweaks to the project (adapted from the DIY Projects Lab website).

## What You Need

*   Raspberry Pi Pico W
*   MicroPython
*   Thonny IDE
*   Basic Micropython/HTML knowledge

## Web Server Setup

1.  Install MicroPython: Download the UF2 file from the [MicroPython website](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/). Hold the BOOTSEL button, connect to your computer, and copy the file to the Pico W.
2.  Install Thonny IDE: Download and install Thonny from [thonny.org](https://thonny.org/).
3.  Connect to Pico W: In Thonny, go to "Tools" -> "Options" -> "Interpreter" and select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)".
4.  Create the following files: `wifi_secrets.py`, `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.py`.
5.  Upload all files to your Pico W.

The Pico W acts as a web server. Access its IP in your browser to control the LED!

## My Changes

*   Refactored HTML
*   CSS: Moved styles to `style.css`.
*   Docs Link: Updated to: [Raspberry Pi Pico W Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html#picow-technical-specification).

You can find the code for this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/yourgithubusername/pico-w-web-server).
